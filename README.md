# FannToolExpanded
This is an independent branch of FannTool not associated or endorsed by the original creator.

FannToolExpanded is a crossplatform GUI that allows for quick and easy creation, training, and testing of FANN Neural Networks.

Requirements:
FLTK 1.3 or above
FLTK 1.3 : http://www.fltk.org/software.php?VERSION=1.3.0

FANN 2.2 or above
FANN 2.2 : https://github.com/libfann/fann

CodeBlocks Project is included.

If you have any problems compiling, set FLTK and FANN libraries in the compiler's "Search directories".
You can do this by creating a folder named "CBLibraries", adding the FANN's "source" folder, and FLTK's "FL", "lib", and "images folder". Then in CodeBlocks, click on settings -> compiler -> search directory -> Compiler tab -> Add all folders -> Linker tab once more add the same folders -> ok.
